Classically, fear in the rodent is operationalized by quantifying the readily identifiable freezing behavior, i.e. a cessation of body movement rodents innately displayed in threatening situations.\nHowever, animals have rich behavioral repertoires beyond the binary freezing response. The primary issue for neuroscientists is that many of these behaviors are not easily identifiable by eye. Recent advances in machine vision now provide the opportunity to analyze behavioural videos with a much finer grain by applying autoregressive models and deep neural networks to parse complex behaviour into discrete syllables or motifs, and identify the sequences of these behavioural motifs. This project will optimize the implementation of an existing package to extract behavioural motifs from rodent behavioural experiments performed in the lab that investigate fear and anxiety.","division":"University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC)","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":246646,"numPositions":1,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Data Analysis","qualifications":"Strong quantitative background required\nRequired technical skills include knowledge of python, jupyter notebooks, and deep neural networks (variational autoencoders).

As refugee children resettle in Canada, they resume learning to read at school. However, refugee children significantly lag behind their peers, both native English-speaking students as well as other newcomers to Canada and English language learners, in reading. While interrupted schooling clearly has a negative impact on literacy, little is known about the specific effects of interrupted schooling across the developmental trajectory for reading, and even less is known about the neurobiological mechanisms by which interrupted schooling impacts the neural systems that support reading. By leveraging the latest tools of educational neuroscience (functional neuroimaging tools, specifically functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy; fNIRS), this research examines the neural systems that support reading development for children who have experienced periods of interrupted schooling at different ages and who have resumed schooling, and learning to read, at an older age.\nProject B Research Summary:\nCote d'Ivoire ranks 171 of 188 countries in the Human Development Index, a statistic measuring life expectancy, education, and health of the population (PNUD, 2015). It is also the largest producer of cocoa in the world. In some rural cocoa-producing communities, the poverty rate reaches 61.2% (Fonds monetaire international, 2009), with many households surviving on $1-2 a day (Co?te d'Ivoire, 2015). It is estimated that 1.3 million school-aged children (out of a population of 3.7 million) are working in cocoa production, which can interfere with education even if children are enrolled in school. The government is committed to expanding educational access through universal basic education for all children ages 6-16. Yet the majority of children who attend school fail to achieve basic literacy and numeracy skills; enrollment and attendance rates remain low, and a large portion of children repeat grades and drop out before completing primary school. This project directly addresses the two primary reasons for this learning crisis: poverty and child labor (which leads to low school enrollment and attendance), and poor teaching quality. To address child labor, this project tests the effects of the most extensively implemented and evidence-based approach-cash transfers (CTs)-which will offer families small amounts of money monthly to ease economic hardship and potentially permit the family to hire an adult farm labor support, in turn increasing the chance that their child will attend school, rather than working on a family plantation. To address educational quality, this project develops and tests the impacts of teacher training and electronic-coaching for teachers in rural communities and explore the utility of using adaptive information and communication technology (ICT)-based interactions for teacher professional development. Understanding if such a platform can affect behavior change and improve professional development will inform the use of similar programs across a range of settings and sectors beyond education. This project is an ongoing randomized control trial that evaluates the impact of poverty reduction (through cash transfers) and quality education on child labor and learning outcomes of children in rural Côte d'Ivoire.\nProject C Research Summary:\n244 million children are currently out of school worldwide. These children are at high risk of never obtaining functional literacy and numeracy, significantly jeopardizing their futures. There are over 1.1 million internally displaced children between the ages of 5-17 in Nigeria. This project evaluates the impact of a technology-enabled accelerated learning program to support out-of-school internally displaced and refugee children in IDP camps. The project examines the impacts of the accelerated learning program on learning outcomes (functional literacy and numeracy skills) as well as social-emotional skills, psychological well-being, educational aspirations, and later school enrollment and progression.","division":"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":246762,"numPositions":2,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Research: Quantitative","qualifications":"Required skills:\n1) Previous coursework in language development, literacy, and/or cognitive development\n2) Previous coursework in statistics and research methods (you may be concurrently enrolled in these classes)\n3) Familiarity with R software or willingness to learn statistical analysis with R\n4) Ability to work in a team, and with families and children\nPreferred (not required)\n5) Speak French, Arabic, Dari, and/or Pashto (research involves French, Arabic, Dari, and Pashto-speaking families).

Across our research and teaching, we examine the complex relationships between humans and technology. Whereas most academic departments are organized by a shared discipline, we are disciplinarily diverse. We bring a variety of theoretical orientations, philosophies, and methodologies to human-technology problems. Because we gather around a shared problem rather than a shared discipline, the breadth of our academic scope is immense. Technology is embedded in human activity in almost every realm: health & medicine, business & finance, gender, race, sexuality, identity, writing & journalism, science, environmentalism, space exploration, activism, class & labour, marketing & public relations, political economy, interpersonal communication, family, war, play, and education.\nThough we study almost every kind of human activity through a diversity of disciplines, faculty at the ICCIT share three basic assumptions that emerge from rigorous research in the humanities and social sciences.

We're currently in the process of creating a condensed, hybrid version of this tool that can be used at the bedside over the course of labor. This new tool will allow women to illustrate and name each labor pain type they are experiencing by a multitude of factors. Our development will allow health care providers involved in women's care to better understand, manage and treat their pain, as well as predict delivery outcomes.\nStudy 2: Developing an Interdisciplinary Patient Support Tool for Women Undergoing Unplanned Cesarean Sections\nEmergency cesarean section is an important predictor for a traumatic childbirth experience and development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women. This mixed-methods study examined women's experiences of their interdisciplinary care immediately before, during, and immediately after urgent or emergency cesarean section. Our aim was to identify stressors and potential solutions as part of development of an interdisciplinary patient support tool (IPST). We are currently in the process of formalizing our IPST, such that we can implement it at our institution and within the broader discipline.\nStudy 3: Developing a Novel Point of Care Test for Postdural Puncture Headache Based on Transcranial Doppler (TCD) Ultrasound\nPostdural puncture headache (\"post-epidural PDPH\") represents the most common, important morbidity of epidural needle placement and results from puncture of the spinal sac during epidural needle insertion. Although formal diagnostic criteria exist for PDPH, these were developed for use after deliberate dural puncture with fine spinal needles and do not account for important differences in epidural needle punctures. The current study aims to develop new diagnostic tests and a bedside diagnostic pathway for post-epidural PDPH based on use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound/sonography.\nTranscranial Doppler ultrasound is a portable, non-invasive modality with established diagnostic utility in a variety of conditions effecting cerebral blood flow, as well as assessment of cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide administration (C02 or vasomotor reactivity). This prospective, two-phase, exploratory, cross-sectional study will determine the optimal threshold change in cerebral blood flow velocity or downstream resistance to flow which best discriminates between postpartum women and without post-epidural PDPH.\nOther studies may also be occurring concurrently.\nSTUDENT PROJECT RESPONSIBILITY AND TASKS\nStudent responsibilities will include the following:\n- Data verification\n- Screening patient charts and consulting with medical staff to determine patient's eligibility for studies\n- Approaching patients about current studies and obtaining informed consent\n- Assisting in setup of medical equipment for studies (e.g., Finapres, Delica)\n- Completing questionnaires with women pre- and post-delivery\n- Maintaining screening, enrollment, and consent logs\n- Screening data collection forms for missing or erroneous data\n- Preparing recruitment summaries for presentation to research team (e.g., number of patients eligible, number of patients excluded, reasons for exclusion, etc.)\n- Assisting research staff with study update reports\n- Verifying electronic data capture with research staff\n- Literature searches\n- Preparing journal club presentations\n- Assisting with ethics submissions or renewals\nWHAT ACADEMIC/CAREER BENEFITS WOULD A STUDENT GAIN FROM THIS POSITION?\nResearch assistants in this position will have direct exposure to impactful studies that simulate interest in evidence-based medicine and women's health research. This experience will enhance students' understanding of clinical research, foster critical thinking skills, and develop hands-on research skills. Involvement in the daily activities of different studies will give students experience navigating how to perform research in a hospital setting. Students will have the opportunity to hone their communication skills when speaking with patients and enhance their ability to abstract data from medical charts on labor, delivery, and pain for research purposes.

Our current work focuses on understanding the foundations of robot learning by using real-world data for creating more realistic simulation environments. We are also interested in novel perception and sensing modalities. Our research spans fundamental problems in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. Current interests involve the following topics:\nRobotics\n: Robotic Perception and Robot Learning with applications in Autonomous Navigation and Manipulation.\nComputer Vision\n: Efficient & Editable Neural 3D Reconstruction, Neuromorphic Vision, Pose & Motion Estimation.\nMachine Learning\n: Geometric Deep Learning, Causal Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning","description":"Massive datasets (such as the combined text of most internet websites) have enabled\nimpressive breakthroughs in approaches such as language modeling in the last year. In\nrobotics, however, obtaining data is often expensive and slow, and existing data is tied to\nspecific robotic hardware (often called the embodiment). In this project, we want to solve\nthis problem by understanding how data gathered from different robotic embodiments can\nbe used to speed up learning for a new robot in a new environment. The core goal (and\nchallenge) is to learn dynamics models or imitation policies from existing data and\ntransferring those to a brand new situation.\nData from other embodiments can take many forms, so the concrete challenges involved in\neach instance can be diverse. For example, one robot might have a fully articulated hand,\nwhile another robot might only have a pincer gripper, but both are mounted to the same\narm. In this case, some of the important aspects of motion, such as how to approach an\nobject for manipulation, are shared, others, like what kind of grasp to attempt, are very\ndifferent. Automatically detecting these differences in embodiment and deciding what\naspect of the data to transfer to a new embodiment are the two core challenges in the\nproject.\nIn this project, students have the opportunity to work on one of the most challenging and\nexciting problems in robot learning. We expect that a successful project can be submitted to\na top venue in machine learning or robotics such as ICRA, RSS, or CORL.

However, batteries still require transformative developments to significantly augment their lifespan and safety, including more granular assessments of their state of health and thermal performance. Batteries are highly constrained by their operating temperatures, which significantly impact their storage capacity, charging/discharging speed, lifetime, and safety. These performance indicators decrease dramatically if batteries are not kept within a narrow temperature range (\n25-40 C (None)\n), requiring battery thermal management systems to guarantee maximum performance, reliability, and safety.\nThis research project will contribute to implementing an experimental approach to characterize spatially distributed heat generation rates, anisotropic thermal conductivities, and specific heat capacities of large-format pouch lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles and stationary energy storage applications. These properties are unique for each cell chemistry, form factor, and battery manufacturing process. Therefore, their accurate characterization, tailored for the target cell and application, is crucial for developing novel battery thermal management systems and their subsequent design optimization.\nStudent's Role:\nThe student will conduct experimental battery testing activities in Prof. Cristina Amon's Thermal Management Systems (TMS) Lab. The student will be responsible for instrumenting cell test fixtures, monitoring tests, and gathering and post-processing transient thermo-electrochemical battery performance data (e.g., temperature, voltage, impedance, and current) and provide this data to other researchers in our labs that are developing high-fidelity numerical models and simulations of lithium-ion battery performance and degradation in collaboration with leading industry partners in the automotive and energy sectors.\nThrough this role, the student will develop\ntechnical skills in battery technology, material characterization, and data analysis\n.

The field of inquiry can range from an analysis of global international relations to the study of individual behaviour; from the examination of institutions to reflection on broad philosophical questions.\n\"Much of the course work in Political Science focuses upon governmental institutions, but the sizable offerings in political theory reflect the Department's traditional strength in that area.

Unfortunately, there remains significant inequities in terms of participation and inclusion of various demographic groups in STEM. This is a unique research project emerging from the efforts of the Canadian Consortium of Science Equity Scholars (a national group of instructors of which Dr. Ashok is a co-investigator; https://scienceequityscholars.ca/), to improve equity and inclusion in STEM courses. This group that spans across several universities in Canada hopes to better understand the undergraduate student population with respect to students' academic identities, self-efficacy, sense of belonging, perceptions of classroom climate, as it relates to learning in STEM courses. The goal of this research is to help inform instructional strategies that will make courses more equitable for all students.\nWe have already collected survey data on the student experience in first year science classrooms in the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years across all three campuses of the University of Toronto. In addition to these survey questionnaires, a demographic survey was used to identify student sub-populations by gender, first-generation university status, ethnicity, language background, Indigenous identity, and disability status. Over this academic year, these data will be analyzed to understand the student experience at UofT across various disciplines, including biology. We are also implementing a new survey and interview-based study that will examine why students choose to withdraw from specific STEM courses. This study will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators at York University.\nAligned with this project, we hope to collect rich qualitative data about the student experience through conducting semi-structured interviews or focus groups with students who have already participated in the surveys. That is, we hope to recruit students to speak with us about about their experiences of inclusion and belonging in biology and chemistry courses. We hope to work with a work study team to conduct these interviews, create de-identified transcripts from those interviews and conduct qualitative data analyses to communicate the main themes of our research findings.\nThe main task of students hired into this team would be to conduct student (peer) interviews and perform quantitative data analyses (with support from the supervisor). Reading and drawing from published science education literature will also be an important requirement of this project role. Finally, creating a final report and presentation of the findings, including contributions to potential conference abstracts or manuscripts, would also be a requirement of this role.\n•Skill Development: Clearly describe how the role allows students to develop and articulate relevant workplace skills and competencies.\nThis work study position trains students in the research process, allowing them to build qualitative and quantitative data analysis skills as well as skills specific to science education research (such as running focus group interviews, creating human subjects research ethics protocols etc.). Students have weekly meetings with the mentor in which they discuss goals and skill development, alongside project progress.\n•Workplace Experience & Belonging: Highlight how the position fosters students' understanding of workplace culture, expectations, and networks.\nStudent teams will work with me, my colleague at York University (Professor of biology), 2 graduate students (1 from Uoft and 1 from York) and about 4-6 undergraduates from York University on this project. We hold weekly online meetings, and the student team members also hold mini meetings outside our large group meetings to get to know each other and build their data analysis skills through collaborative work. This type fo structure not only builds a sense of belonging for students but also mimics a research group environment in which trainees at various levels and mentors often work together. In addition, learning to work with students from a different university who are at the same stage of academic training, will undoubtedly help students build their workplace experience and sense of belonging.\n•Academic Connection: Show how the role connects the student's academic studies to real-world workplace competencies.\nStudent seldom have opportunities to engage in research projects that translate into interventions that help students from all backgrounds to feel supported to learn, build more inclusive and equitable learning environments and understand the experience of many of our students in STEM classrooms (both positive and not so positive). This type of position not only builds awareness of diversity and multiculturalism, it allows students to truly appreciate the ways in which we can create inclusive learning spaces and hence, inclusive workplaces. This is effectively firsthand training for students to continue to build future careers that align with UTSC's inclusive excellence mandate.\n•Career Reflection & Growth: Ensure there are opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences and explore how these relate to future career possibilities.\nThe students are asked to present on their experience in the project at the midway and endpoint of the work study session. In preparation for those presentations, students are encouraged to reflect on their experience and discuss their goals and skill development in our weekly meetings.","division":"University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC)","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":247095,"numPositions":1,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Research: Qualitative","qualifications":"-Completed (and excelled at) 2nd year core courses in Biology degree program\n-Enthusiasm for science education/pedagogical research\n-Interest in learning (or prior experience with) qualitative data analysis and conducting semi-structured interviews or focus groups\n-Experience working effectively in diverse teams of students\n-Effective oral and written communication\n-Demonstrated ability to speak to peers in a culturally sensitive and empathetic manner about their experience in courses\n-Maturity and trustworthiness to work with confidential and/or sensitive research project data and findings\n- Basic knowledge of R (i.e., intro statistics level) is an asset","scholarshipRecipientPreference":"Preference will be given to President's Scholars\nPreference will be given to Pearson Scholars","skills":"Collaboration\nCommunication\nFostering Inclusivity and Equity\nInquiry\nInvestigation and Synthesis\nKnowledge Application to Daily Life","supervisor":"Aarthi Ashok","supervisorTitle":"Professor, Teaching Stream","title":"Inclusion & Belonging in STEM classrooms - Research Assistant","weeklySchedule":"Variable Hours","workStudyStream":"Research Experience Stream"},{"accessibilityAccommodations":"I confirm accommodations will be made available as needed by the candidate","accessibilityConsiderations":"Spends the majority of the shift working at a computer\nOccurs in a hybrid environment","applicationDeadline":"April\n 30, 2025\n 11:59 PM","applicationDocuments":"Resume,Cover Letter,Transcript (Unofficial)","applicationProcedure":"Through CLNx","campusLocation":"Mississauga","degreeLevel":null,"department":"Department of Management","departmentOverview":"At the Department of Management at the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTMM), we do things a little differently.

Her lab has shown that in addition to beneficial mechanisms that support recovery, there are deleterious mechanisms in the sub-acute and chronic stages of injury giving rise to cognitive and neural deterioration. Moreover, her lab recently demonstrated that volumetric losses to the whole-brain, hippocampus and corpus callosum are substantive and affect the large majority of patients.\nHer lab is focused on re-conceptualizing TBI as a chronic and possibly neurodegenerative disease process; this novel conception is needed in order to identify parallels with other forms of neurodegeneration in order to open new avenues of treatment. A converging program of research concerns chronic traumatic encephalopathy - another progressive disorder secondary to TBI, but the result of multiple mild events. Encouragingly, the lab has found an association between \"environmental enrichment\" and reduced neurodegeneration in TBI. Using findings from these basic research programs, she is currently engaged in the development of interventions to improve cognitive and neural recovery by offsetting deterioration using environmental enrichment in concert with other clinical interventions.","description":"We are a Clinical Neuropsychology research lab carrying out research primarily with people with traumatic brain injury.

Under the direction supervision and guidance of the Lab Coordinator, this position will allow students to develop the following:\n•Skills Development:\nLab Assistants will develop a \"tool kit\" of Earth Science-specific workplace skills and competencies including\ntechnical and transferable skills that are relevant to a Geology/Earth Science work setting. Technical workplace skills include use of a petrographic microscope, geological thin section analysis and description, collections management through hands-on experiences in the teaching labs. Transferable workplace skills include teamwork through working with other lab assistants, staff, and faculty on shared tasks, time management skills through pacing work and meeting deadlines, and communication through daily check-ins to discuss learning and ideas with the supervisor. In discussion with the supervisor, students will identify which skills or concepts they would like to explore in greater depth and determine which tasks will provide the opportunity to build on these skillsets.\n•Workplace Experience & Belonging: Students will develop a professional network and recognize the importance of their role by collaborating with Earth Science staff, faculty, and other students (and potentially staff/faculty in other departments, campuses, and museums). Students will complete safety training and implement their training through daily tasks (e.g. wearing PPE when handling acid to test geological material), which provides students an authentic workplace experience. Through these experiences, students will develop an understanding of workplace expectations and culture in various work settings and understand how individual roles offer an important contribution to the bigger picture. Students will reflect on the various tasks and learning experiences throughout the work-study position to identify potential career pathways.\n•Academic Connection: Students will reflect on how concepts, knowledge, theories, and skills learned in their academic studies connect with, and directly contribute to, the work experience as a Lab Assistant in an Earth Science lab. Students will also reflect on how they can apply new skills learned through the work experience to enhance their academics and identify new areas of interest gained through the work-study experience. Students will identify additional courses to explore new interests and skills/knowledge in greater depth.\n•Career Reflection & Growth: Students will reflect on how aspects of this Work-Study experience may prepare them for a future career in Earth Sciences and discuss the academic requirements for professional certification for P.Geo. (Professional Geoscientists Ontario) with the supervisor. Students will review their resume with the supervisor, discuss how to effectively communicate areas of strength with specific examples from the work-study experience, and identify parts of the resume that are potentially lacking experience.

A key facet of performing research in the laboratory is the management of a zebrafish facility and this requires that all members of the lab develop technical skills in animal husbandry and maintaining specific genetic strains. Indeed, all members of the lab regularly participate in the management of our fish because it is so important and integral to our research. The zebrafish husbandry tasks are performed in our fish room located in the aquatic animal facility while the genotyping analyses and research support tasks are done in our main lab spaces. During zebrafish husbandry and research support task training, the student will be working with the laboratory technician. Once this training is complete, the student will work independently, with a basic understanding of normal operations in the facility and other lab spaces, and an awareness of whom to contact if any issues arise. Training on tasks related to the maintenance of genetic strains, such as breeding or genotyping, will initially be undertaken by the lab technician but there is also an opportunity for the student to learn these skills from other members of the lab, such as PhD students or Research Associate. Overall, this will give the student an opportunity for workplace skills training in a research environment that is highly collaborative and espouses a responsible team approach to learning.","description":"The zebrafish facility assistant will integrate into our team approach for managing our zebrafish colony by learning new skills in zebrafish husbandry and other research support tasks, including participating in the maintenance of genetically modified strains. Specific competencies related to zebrafish husbandry include (1) learning about nutritional standards by using a diverse feeding regime that promotes healthy growth and breeding; and (2) behavioural observation, which will allow the student to understand typical healthy behaviour and to identify fish that have potential health problems. Specific competencies related to the maintenance of genetic strains will include (1) genotyping, which involves tissue sample collection, isolating genomic DNA, PCR amplifying the genomic region of interest and preparing PCR samples for sequencing or performing restriction digestion as appropriate for the region of interest, and (2) breeding that would require setting up male and female breeding pairs with different genotypes to derive progeny with specific alleles that would be needed for raising a new generation of genetically modified strains. The student will also participate in other research support tasks, such as washing lab glassware, racking pipette tips, and autoclaving, all of which are central for ensuring sterile procedures are employed for genotyping and related molecular biology techniques.\nIn this role, students will develop core competencies in animal nutrition, behaviour, and genetics in our specific neurobiology research context. However, this position represents an opportunity to develop and articulate workplace skills that are useful in different types of research labs that use animal models, specifically animal husbandry and maintaining genetically modified strains, as well as workplace skills useful in a broader range of STEM labs. In addition, students will further develop their workplace experience by learning professionalism skills in a collaborative research environment, which includes regularly attending their sessions on time and completing their assigned tasks, learning to be good communicators (by notifying supervisor of any problems that come up, giving notice when they need to miss a session), prioritizing tasks (to decide which research support tasks to tackle in any given session) and time management (balancing their work in the lab with their schoolwork). Importantly, since all members of the lab participate in the management of the zebrafish facility, students will have an opportunity to build workplace experience while learning how to navigate expectations and values in a research team environment.\nStudents considering a career in research, especially those interested in animal health and behaviour or genetic analysis and/or neurodevelopment, will benefit from this position. Some of our past students have found the job experience in a lab setting helpful for deciding whether they would like to pursue research further. This position has translated to career possibilities in animal care and research for past students, with some going on to veterinary school and some to graduate school in life sciences labs. Some students who have held this position before their final undergraduate year have found the reference letter from us helpful for obtaining placements for undergraduate research courses or research summer jobs.\nPerforming the fish husbandry and research support task components of the position takes about 6 to 6.5 hours per week in four or five shorter (1 to 2.5 hour) sessions rather than one long session. Applicants should be comfortable with the fact that the days and times of their sessions will not be chosen by them but rather be determined by a combination of well-established lab fish feeding schedules, the student's own schedule, and the class schedules of the other students hired. Please include with your application the days of the week and blocks of time you would be available to work.\nStudents will have some flexibility in co-developing their training profile, for example the extent to which they want to learn genotyping techniques contributing to various research projects, bearing in mind that the total amount of paid time they may work over the summer is the program maximum of 100 hours. The genotyping analyses will be performed at times that are agreeable to both the student and the supervisor.","division":"Faculty of Arts & Science","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":247788,"numPositions":2,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Lab Coordination and Assistance","qualifications":"The following qualifications are required for this position:\nReliability-students must attend their workplace session unless they are sick, have a family emergency or have given notice of a conflict, e.g. midterm exam.\nPunctuality-it is important fish husbandry tasks are performed at the required times (e.g. feeding) because this will dictate the efficiency in breeding that is critical for our research.\nAbility to follow instructions-we train students by verbal instruction, by having them perform tasks under supervision, by providing written instructions to refer to as necessary, and by giving them the opportunity to write their own instructions.

The work of the current laboratory falls into the general category of research in developmental psychology.","description":"The Laboratory for Infant Studies conducts research on perceptual development, multisensory integration, and perceptual-motor interaction. Laboratory assistants will assist in all phases of the research process. This includes, but is not limited to: assistance in developing stimulus materials, calling and scheduling participants, coding data tapes, collating and analyzing data, running participants, lab maintenance, and so on. The qualifications for these positions are good interpersonal skills and an interest in psychology. Computer background and laboratory experience is desirable, but are not prerequisites.\nIn addition to the above, this position provides the following Work Integrated Learning experiences:\nSkill Development\n: These positions enable students to gain relevant work study skills including:\nprofessional social interaction skills\ndeveloped through interaction with community members (parents with young children) for participant scheduling and data collection;\ndata coding and data visualization\n, developed through the use of current data coding platforms (ELAN, Datavyu) needed for preliminary analyses of data;\ndata organization and management skills\nprovided through maintaining lab records and experimental participation logs;\ntechnical skills\nprovided by employing sophisticated software for perceptual development, and perceptual-motor data collection. Such software includes animation software (Blender - open source 3D graphics software tool), video-editing software (DaVinci Resolve, CapCut video editor, NCH VideoPad Video Editor), postural control data collection software (Kistler BioWare©), locomotor kinematic data collection software (GAITRite©), coding/programming skills provided through the use of both Matlab programming language and PsychoPy®, and statistical analysis software through the use of Jamovi open statistical software.\nWorkplace Experience, Networks, and Belonging\n: Because these positions are fundamentally community-facing (my research depends on positive interactions with community members), appropriate professional workplace culture and expectations are interwoven throughout all aspects of the position. Such culture and expectations begin during the interview phase for these positions, in which the professional responsibilities of the positions are made clear to potential work study students. Such responsibilities include detailed adherence to scheduling constraints (e.g., proper procedures for scheduling of participants, being on time for parent/child appointments, meeting deadlines for coding of participant data), appropriate workplace interactions and demeanor with community members, and so on. Additionally, because my lab collaborates with other developmental psychology laboratories at UTSC (the TEMPO lab of Prof. L. Cirelli, the Developmental and Computational Affective Cognition lab of Pro. Y. Wu) for participant recruitment and maintenance of a participant database, work study students build a significant professional network with respect to other faculty and students involved in child development research.\nAcademic Connection\n: Because the Laboratory for Infant Studies engages in professional level research in perception development and perceptual-motor integration and development, real-world work experiences in the laboratory connect directly with research content presented across a range of academic classes. These courses include both content specific class focusing on general aspects of development, as well as adult perception, cognition, and human movement (the primary topics investigated in the lab), as well as content general courses focusing on statistical analysis, research structure and design, and scientific communication.\nContent specific courses\n: PSYA02 (Introduction to Clinical, Development, Personality, and Social Psychology), PSYB20 (Introduction to Developmental Psychology), PSYB51 (Introduction to Perception), PSYB57 (Introduction to Cognitive Psychology), PSYC21 (Adulthood and Aging), PSYC22 (Infancy), PSYC23 (Developmental Psychobiology), PSYC24 (Childhood and Adolescence), PSYC27 (Social Development), PSYC28 (Emotional Development), PSYC72 (Developmental Psychology Laboratory), PSYC74 (Human Movement Laboratory), PSYD20 (Current Topics in Developmental Psychology), PSYD22 (Socialization Processes), PSYD23 (Dyadic Processes in Psychology Development), PSYD24 (Seeing, Hearing, and Moving in Children), PSYD28 (The Development of Affective Cognition).\nContent general courses\n: PSYB07 (Data Analysis in Psychology), PSYB70 (Methods in Psychological Science), PSYB90 (Supervised Introductory Research in Psychology). PSYC02 (Scientific Communication in Psychology), PSYC08 (Advanced Data Analysis in Psychology), PSYC70 (Advanced Research Methods Laboratory), PSYC90/C93 (Supervised Study in Psychology), PSYD98 (Thesis in Psychology)\nCareer Reflection and Growth\n: Work study positions in the lab provide opportunities for reflection on experiences, as well as exploration of future career possibilities, in multiple ways. One principal venue for such reflection and growth occurs in bi-weekly lab meetings. These meetings fill a range of purposes. For instance, for these meetings work study students are asked to read relevant background studies related to ongoing projects, with this background literature then discussed at lab meetings in an informal seminar-like experience. Such meetings allow students to reflect on the topic and hand, and to relate their daily work experiences to this professional material. Additionally, these discussions provide a forum for students to develop their own critical analysis skills, with respect to both the background literature and the ongoing lab research. A second goal of these meetings is to provide students with the experience of learning to report on work in progress in the lab. In such \"operational\" meetings, students are asked to summarize their work on ongoing projects, and to provide an analysis of what is currently working in these projects, as well as the limitations of the paradigms and studies. A second venue for reflection and growth occurs through the opportunity to interact with graduate students in the lab, as well as senior undergraduate project (PSYC90/C93 and PSYD98) students. In both cases, these (graduate and undergraduate) students provide critical role models for work study students, modelling professionally relevant behaviors and commitments to their fields of study. Additionally, both sets of individuals provide critical information regarding professional and career opportunities growing out of research experience in the lab.","division":"University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC)","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":247810,"numPositions":1,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Research: Quantitative","qualifications":"The Laboratory for Infant Studies is hiring undergraduate Research Assistants (RA) to assist with a variety of projects investigating the perceptual development, multisensory perception and its development, and perceptual-motor integration.

relationship of teaching, research and the larger concerns of society. The Department structures its academic programs historically, a practice that has readily accommodated changes that reflect the development of English studies as a discipline and the changing mission of the university. Entirely new areas of study such as world literature in English, children's literature, Indigenous North American literature and the digital text have been added to the curriculum. Even in courses with the most traditional titles such as Shakespeare or the Victorian novel, the selection of texts as well as the way they are taught undergoes regular reassessment and alteration. So too does the department's effort to improve the quality of the communication skills of the many students it teaches.\nMembers of the department contribute to the teaching of interdisciplinary programs at both the undergraduate level (e.g., Canadian studies, Christianity and culture, cinema studies, women's studies) and the graduate level (comparative literature, drama, medieval studies). In less obvious, but perhaps even more important ways, members of the department bring their interdisciplinary interests to their English courses, addressing such areas as the relationship between English literature and literature in other languages; literature and the other arts, sciences, history and philosophy; and the nature of literary language. In short, our concern is the place of a work of literature in the culture of its time - and in ours - and with literature not only as a passive reflector, but as an active moulder of culture.\nAs well as examining our cultures in the broadest sense, the study of English also focuses on training students to think and write critically. The skills involved in the analysis and evaluation of complex data, and the marshalling of evidence to present convincing arguments have always played a central role in English studies. Critical thinking and effective writing are the constant goals of a changing curriculum.Undergraduate English is taught by separate departments on the three campuses of the University of Toronto: St. George, Mississauga and Scarborough. The graduate department of English at the University of Toronto is a three-campus department consisting of all English faculty appointed to the three campuses.","description":"The students appointed will work with me on one or more of my current research projects in the field of British literature and history 1660-1820.

CanPath allows researchers to explore how genetics, environment, lifestyle, and behaviour interact and contribute to the development of cancer and other chronic diseases. It is a living population laboratory containing a wealth of data from more than 330,000 Canadians - the largest data collection of its kind in Canadian history - aged 30-74 who are voluntarily sharing their health and biological information over several decades. This data is studied by researchers to better understand disease risk factors to help unlock the mysteries of chronic disease and cancer.\nThis year, CanPath is embarking on a pan-Canadian study called HEALthy Eating and Supportive Environments (HEAL). Its goal is to identify, for the first time in Canada, retail food environment factors that shape dietary intake at the population level. It has two main aims: (1) evaluate associations between the retail food environment and diet quality regarding alignment with the 2019 Canada's Food Guide, as measured by the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019, at the community, provincial and national levels in Canada; and (2) examine whether associations between the retail food environment and diet quality vary by a) built and social environment factors and b) individual-level risk factors for chronic disease.\nUsing news media, social media, the CanPath website, and other channels, we amplify research conducted by scientists using CanPath data to communicate their findings to CanPath participants, the general public, prospective researchers, partners, and funders.

By recruiting a student team that reflects a range of student perspectives and experiences, we can work together with students to design inclusive and welcoming course activities and environments that reflect their interests and priorities. Students can expect to be encouraged to reflect on and express their values and goals and explore how these can be supported by the course research activities they are creating.","description":"Biology project design assistants will play a central role in developing research projects and associated course materials for use in the Bio-CURE undergraduate biology course centred around student-driven discovery through scientific research. Bio-CURE uses a \"for students, by students\" model to continually add to and update the research opportunities offered each year in the course. Work Study students will work collaboratively with peers, supervisors, and UTSC researchers to design, test, and optimize research activities related to various fields of study in biological sciences. Activities will include attending weekly progress meetings, working on experiments in various research facilities around campus, and participating in lab operations (propagation of model organisms, experiment prep/clean-up, equipment maintenance, etc). Students will mine the scientific literature (with the help of the instructor) to select methodology and research data to inform the design and analysis of their research activities. Students will also participate in critical examination of the literature on course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) to follow evidence-based practices in the design of course materials and activities. Finally, the student will be an active participant in brainstorming discussions and provide critical feedback on the logistics and potential student responses to the planned course activities. The goal of the project is to create an impactful and engaging research experience for biology students, and the Work Study project design assistants provide the student perspectives needed to help tailor the course to the needs, abilities, and interests of their peers. As such, we seek to assemble a team that includes students from a diversity of backgrounds, interests, abilities, and experience levels.\nThrough working on this project, Work Study students will get to experience a lab/research workplace, including the responsibilities involved in maintaining day-to-day research operations, contacting and interacting with other researchers, establishing standard operating procedures, and adhering to safety standards. Throughout the work term, students will work on projects in several areas of biology, allowing them to apply concepts from a variety of biology courses including Cell Biology, Immunology, Ecology, Plant Biology, and Conservation Biology. This provides hands-on training to complement the theoretical knowledge they have obtained thus far in their degree, and allows skill development for a range of research-related careers in academic, industry, medical, and government environments. Specifically:\nStudents will improve in the literature search skills and learn to leverage published data to inform the design and optimization of their own lab protocols.\nReceiving feedback on their protocol design will help students evaluate their progress and work on developing their skills in responding to feedback and revising their work.\nThrough conducting trial experiments, students will learn and demonstrate attention to detail, record keeping, and analytical skills\nStudents will practice routine lab techniques including liquid handling, preparing buffers, and sterilization, which are transferable to a variety of lab settings.\nStudents will gain hands-on experience in specialized techniques, including field work, cell culture, and aseptic technique, which are valuable skills in various types of research, diagnostic, and consulting/assessment careers.\nStudents will develop and demonstrate critical thinking skills as they assess the efficacy of their lab approaches and suggest next steps for improvement in brainstorming discussions\nStudents will develop and demonstrate oral and written communication skills as they present their work in team meetings and prepare course materials explaining protocols and background knowledge in written documents targeted to second year undergraduate students\nStudents will work collaboratively in their project design and data collection and will reflect on the development of their teamwork skills.\nStudents will have opportunities to reflect on their skill development and areas for further practice as they receive feedback in weekly team meetings, mentorship advice on applying to related career paths, and complete work integrated learning training modules available to students in the Work Study program.","division":"University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC)","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":247931,"numPositions":1,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Research: Mixed-Methods","qualifications":"The ideal candidate will be a third- or fourth-year undergraduate student in a Biological Sciences program who is excited about contributing to our future curriculum.

Feminist Sports Club is a new initiative at WGSI that combines community-building with professional/pedagogical development, giving graduate student TAs and CIs opportunities to explore experiential learning strategies and frameworks both among themselves and through engagement with undergraduate students.

Specific workplace skills and competencies include: practising workplan development and accountability skills; tracking and meeting deadlines; building grantwriting skills such as the synthesis of key trends and needs as well as opportunities for potential funders and participants; learning how to map a field of literature in visual as well as text forms; learning and practising how to identify, document, and prioritize journalistic and public discourses on the topic of artificial intelligence related to the topic at hand; developing independent work habits; and practising working collegially with researchers from different levels of the academy. Most of these skills transfer directly to research, marketing, fundraising, and policy development positions in non-academic sectors as well.\nThis position fosters students' understanding of workplace culture, expectations, and networks through the setting of weekly goals with the supervisor and reflecting these in their workplan for the project. To assist the RA in developing their ability to work as part of a team but with independent responsibilities, the RA will participate in regular team or individual meetings (weekly at first, then every fortnight), as well as briefings on the projects by the postdoctoral fellows and faculty involved, and discussions with the other Research Assistant conducting similar work. They are also able to access the amazing Digital Unit at the UTSC library, who carry excellent expertise in the areas the RA will be working on. To develop their skills with the scholarly and culture sector networks involved in the project, the RA will work directly with participating authors and co-editors on the project, and report through debriefings at the midway point and end of the project to check on ways in which the RA considers their own contributions to have met goals and objectives for the project and their own skill development.\nThe role connects the student's academic studies to real-world workplace competencies by having them participate as a full member of the research team. This is a great project for someone who has already developed some research skills in scanning, summarizing, annotating and synthesizing research literature in one of the fields noted above or a related field. The mapping process includes and will enhance these skills, but also combines them with visual presentation softwares and potentially the development of infographics or other visual ways of representing the work. Additionally, the RA will learn or practise open and emotion coding, including how to code themes, keywords, key players, linkages among key players, costs and resources, and scope or reach of particular AI softwares and activities. There is an emphasis on learning about copyright and intellectual property management in the culture sector. This is one of the most crucial sites of contention in AI today across all fields of work, and will translate to real-world competencies not just for policy, research, or scholarly writing projects, but also for students interested in being creative content producers, media directors, social media influencers, etc.\nThere are many opportunities for students to reflect on their experiences and explore how these relate to future career possibilities, including the weekly/fortnightly meetings, the setting of goals and discussion of challenges along the way, working with and discussing how the project is going with team members and librarians informally and formally, the midpoint debriefing and end-of-project debriefing, and through emails and communications with the broader network of participating authors and co-editors, as well as by sourcing material from appropriate media sources and U of T's capacious library.

They promote humanities education in general and foster liberal arts education. Students in both disciplines are introduced to a wide range of methods, theories and practices.\nThis project will contribute to the student's professional development in the following ways:\nThe student will hone their skills in writing and editing to the level of an academic publication. They will utilize detail-oriented thinking to critically vet sources of information and ensure strict adherence to publication citation standards. It will be the student's responsibility to multitask being reliable and accountable for their own work, while also providing support to the other contributors and keeping them on track with deadlines.\nThe student will gain first-hand experience of the academic publication process; including professional standards, copyright restrictions, and organizing a peer review. They will engage in and be copied on professional communications with their supervisor, fellow contributing authors, the publisher, and external experts. Through this project the student will develop their sense of self as a scholar, engaging in academic dialogue with fellow scholars.\nThe student will learn about the quality of research and written composition required to take a course-level paper and elevate it to be publication ready. Over the course of preparing a manuscript for publication, the student will gain an appreciation for the labour and scholarly standards that go into the texts they read in their university studies. This project will allow the student to see their work contribute to the greater body of academic knowledge.\nThe student's professional communications with fellow scholars, publishers, and professional organizations will help them to make connections within the world of academic publishing. These connections combined with the knowledge gained from this experience will give the student a good foundation if they should wish to publish future papers, or professionally aid other scholars in seeking publication. Finally, having their name attached to a quality publication will serve as proof of the student's scholarly abilities in their future endeavours.\nFor this project, the student will be working on a large undertaking that will include correspondence with the contributors to the project (including IT and photography experts), the preparation and checking of source materials, the preparation of regional maps, the verification of notes, and general organization. Qualifications include a comprehensive familiarity with the Chicago Manual of Style and its application to all aspects of textual presentation. An excellent knowledge of grammar, spelling, English usage, proof-reading skills and attention to minute details is essential. Knowledge of Excel and PhotoShop / LightRoom are definite attributes.

Sociolegal studies, explores the intersection of law with our social world, deepening our understanding of political, cultural, and socio-economic factors. Research by faculty at the Centre covers a wide range of topics and methodological approaches. Some faculty work with large data sets to ask questions about criminal justice. Others work with a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Others are engaged in socio-legal research, which sometimes uses legal materials as well as empirical research but asks different questions than those conventionally asked in law faculties. These approaches are seen as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, and we encourage students to pursue a variety of interests rather than specialize in one method or one theory: unlike some graduate departments, our dissertation committees are not necessarily composed of faculty who share the same training or interests.\nWhat we value\nOur department is deeply committed to diversity, inclusion, and justice, recognizing the historical and ongoing impact of racism, particularly against Black and Indigenous communities. CrimSL focuses on understanding the exercise of state power and its implications in daily life, including within the criminal justice system and policing. We acknowledge the embedded nature of racism in Canadian institutions and strive to address it through research, education, and advocacy.\nFurthermore, we are dedicated to promoting equality and justice within public institutions and commit to fulfilling our role as scholars and educators. Through public education, advocacy, and research, we seek to raise awareness about structural racism, promote transparency, and hold institutions accountable. As scholars, we recognize the importance of providing data and analysis to inform policy aimed at reducing racism and advancing equality. Additionally, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and anti-racist environment within our department and the wider community. We will continue to engage with faculty, students, and staff to deepen our understanding and address issues of racism and inequality. Our efforts include hosting public forums, advocating for community involvement in policing decisions, and dedicating resources to research relevant to anti-Black racism, indigenous discrimination, gender and sexual orientation discrimination, and criminal justice.","description":"Description\nThe researcher will support research and publications underway related to projects to advance knowledge in specific areas of interest in Sociolegal Studies.

LINCDIRE has proved a solid and forward-looking endeavour able to links different educational traditions and cultures across countries, languages, and levels of education (from elementary to tertiary). The project has developed a unique theoretical framework and has developed a website which includes an online environment with an LMS with a series of action-oriented tasks that help learners to learn languages effectively and in a more meaningful and holistic way, alongside acquiring a reflective attitude towards language learning.\nMore recently the project expanded through a new SSHRC funded Insight Grant Advancing Agency in Language Education.\nThe AALE research project pursues two interconnected goals: (a) to investigate factors (enablers and obstacles) that impact teachers' agency in shifting from treating languages as objects of study to languages as resources for communication and action; and (b) to facilitate this shift through the collaborative development of principles around technology-mediated action-oriented approaches that are applicable to diverse teaching traditions and contexts.\nLanguage education that values the individual's existing linguistic and cultural resources is crucial for the development of an inclusive and diverse society. However, current pedagogical practices largely fail to leverage learners' existing linguistic resources and contribute to the decline in student motivation for learning multiple languages. Outdated teaching methodologies continue to permeate teacher's and learner's beliefs, impeding the adoption of plurilingual, action-oriented and technology-integrated pedagogies that encourage learner agency and use of their entire linguistic repertoire. This research examines teacher beliefs/practices, and supports the timely renewal of pedagogies through teacher collaboration and professional development.\nDrawing on plurilingual, action-oriented and technology-integrated pedagogies and on the outcomes of the LINCDIRE project, our multiphase study investigates the systemic and contextual factors that promote or inhibit pedagogical innovation We are using mixed methods and design-based research, collecting rich data in second/additional language classes in four Canadian regions within three major Canadian provinces (Ontario, Alberta and Quebec) to examine language teaching realities while identifying shared challenges and enabling the cross-pollination of teacher expertise. Findings will be disseminated through scholarly journals, presentations, and social media.\nThe project is in its phase 3 and the team is working on the data analysis and is developing a toolkit for professional development in the three core area of the project.\nThe project will contribute to move forward teachers' beliefs and practices in relation to plurilingualism. purposeful integration of technology in their classes and the action-oriented approach.

Economics, Finance, and Computer Science students are preferred, but this is not a hard requirement given sufficient demonstration of qualifications. More information on required and preferred qualifications are listed later on.\nThis project will involve providing research assistance to complete academic papers in the fields of economics and finance, aimed towards publication at top journals in the fields, such as Econometrica, American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, Review of Economic Studies, and Quarterly Journal of Economics in economics, and Journal of Finance, Review of Financial Studies, and Journal of Financial Economics in finance.\nOne of the three sub-projects is finalizing the paper \"A Theory of Dynamic Product Awareness and Targeted Advertising\" by Laurent Cavenaile, Murat Alp Celik, Jesse Perla, and Pau Roldan-Blanco, which has already received a revise and resubmit decision from Journal of Political Economy. You can find a working paper version at:\nhttps://muratcelik.faculty.economics.utoronto.ca/?page_id=17 (https://muratcelik.faculty.economics.utoronto.ca/?page_id=17)\nThe second sub-project is on licensing, its macroeconomic implications, and interactions with innovation, firm dynamics, and economic growth. Expected to result in a large number of publications, this project involves creating a large interconnected database that ties inter-firm licensing deals to existing datasets on firm financial information, patents, inventors, M&A, and litigation, among other things.\nThe third sub-project is finalizing a set of papers that study directed innovation under production and idea networks across industries as well as locations. The direction of innovation - how scarce R&D resources are allocated between industries - can have a first-order impact on long-run growth and social welfare. Holding the aggregate amount of R&D spending fixed, the direction of innovation that arises in a decentralized equilibrium can differ substantially from the socially optimal one in the presence of externalities, such as within- and across industry knowledge spillovers, and lead to misallocation in innovation. The aim of these papers will be to develop a quantitative directed innovation framework with input-output networks in both production and innovation activities to study optimal dynamic industrial policy that can address this misallocation, taking downstream and upstream impacts into account.\nAs an integral member of the team, you will be involved in various phases of the research project, collaborating closely with senior researchers to advance our understanding in this area and learn essential tools in economics and finance research.\nPrimary Duties:\n· Develop and maintain expertise in new research methodologies and techniques.\n· Manage and manipulate data using requested software, such as Python, R, Stata, Julia, C++, Fortran, or Matlab (different tasks require different languages; not all will be required).\n· Conduct background research and literature reviews.\n· Collect, clean, synthesize, and analyze data.

Our department is concerned with the interdisciplinary study of the civilizations and cultures of the Near and Middle East from Neolithic times until the present, including their archaeology, history, mythology, religion and thought, art and architecture, and language and literature (Akkadian, Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Aramaic, Coptic, Ge'ez, Hebrew, Persian, Sumerian, Syriac, and Turkish). The Department's programs provide students with a unique opportunity to study non-Western complex societies and civilizations.\nThe term Near East has been used in scholarship to refer to the region of Southwest Asia at the eastern end of the Mediterranean, including the Levant, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Anatolia, from ancient times until the advent of Islam in the seventh century AD. The term Middle East refers to a broader geographical area stretching from North Africa to West and Central Asia. Although Islam became the predominant religious culture and remains so to the present day, the Middle East has been home to many religious communities, including Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and others. And while Arabic functioned as the interlanguage in much the same way as Latin did in the Christian West, many other languages and cultures (notably Persian and Turkish) contributed to the formation of Islamic civilization.\nThe Department welcomes students of all academic backgrounds who wish to learn about the Near and Middle East. Many courses do not require knowledge of the languages of the region. However, the Department strongly believes that a deeper understanding of the cultures of the Near and Middle East can be achieved through the study of one or more of its languages.\nThe archaeological data to be processed is located at the Royal Ontario Museum's West Asia Section, which holds the largest collection of Ancient Near Eastern artifacts in Canada. U of T and the ROM have an established history of collaboration, both in teaching as well as academic research. The project director also holds the position of Curator for the ROM's Ancient Near Eastern collection.","description":"Hamoukar Publication Project\nThe Hamoukar expedition was a joint Syrian-American archaeological project undertaken between the University of Chicago's Oriental institute, the Syrian Department of Antiquities, and (since 2008) the University of Toronto's Department of Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations at the site of Hamoukar (Hassakeh province, Syria.

A well-known example is \"quantum dots\" which exhibit strongly size-dependent optical and quantum effects; their discovery and development garnered a 2023 Nobel prize. Another example is gold nanoparticles which give stain glass windows their red colour. A theme of the Dhirani group's research is to use nanostructures as building blocks to fabricate materials and devices, exploiting their \"designer\" nature to \"engineer\" desired system behaviour from the bottom up. Examples include new materials that change resistance due to quantum hybridization and new devices that efficiently absorb solar light and produce electricity or hydrogen to address the climate crisis.\nIn this work study position, students will have an opportunity to:\ndesign, fabricate, characterize and explore the range of behaviours of nanostructured materials and devices, and\ndevelop potential device applications.\nStudents will begin by performing a literature review. In the first phase of an experiment, they will fabricate and characterize nanostructured systems. In the second phase of the experiment, students will help take measurements of and/or apply system properties.\nStudents will receive multiple experiential learning opportunities, including the following:\nopportunity to develop and articulate workplace skills and competencies: A key workplace skill is to learn new knowledge and skills and to solve problems towards achieving a goal.

This connection will be emphasized in this project so that students will be able to articulate it in the context of future work opportunities.\nAn opportunity to build workplace experience, networks, and self-knowledge, such as navigating workplace expectations, sense of belonging, identities and values: Students will work in groups with other follow undergraduate students and under supervision of more senior group members. They will also participate in bi-weekly meetings to discuss progress, challenges and next steps. This will give students an opportunity to experience working in teams to meet work place expectations, such as contributing and navigating situations where hypotheses are tested.\nOpportunity to explore how academic studies connect to workplace competencies: This work study opportunity will build on students' academic studies, e.g. chemistry and physics lab and lecture experiences. Such experiences provide good background knowledge. In the work student experience, students will explore creating new knowledge. Being able to build on a base of academic knowledge following the scientific method is an extremely valuable skill that students will develop and that can be translated to many workplaces.\nOpportunity to reflect on how the Work Study experience translates to career possibilities: The work study opportunity relates to developing devices for converting solar energy to electricity or hydrogen.

The candidate would be required to thoroughly read and understand published literature, extract information that is relevant to the project's research questions, and develop ways to summarize and synthesize extracted data (e.g., through charts and tables). This would allow the candidate to develop various research skills, including understanding a body of literature, extracting and summarizing information on research methods and outcomes, and communicating research findings. In supporting the planned meta-analysis, the candidate is also expected to enhance their statistical knowledge, as they would be required to extract, interpret, and summarize the statistical results reported in the literature.\nFor candidates interested in pursuing research, this project will help enhance their understanding of experiment design methodology, statistical analysis, and academic writing. These skills are also transferable to various workplaces outside of academia as many careers require data processing and analysis skills, as well as strong communications skills. Additionally, for candidates who are interested in the field of automation design and human-automation interaction, this project would provide them with a breadth of knowledge about the literature in the field, as well as specialized knowledge across various application domains (e.g., automation in driving). Finally, the project is expected to enhance the candidate's teamwork and communication skills as they would be working as part of a team and collaborating with senior trainees, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Through mentorship from the project supervisor and senior trainees, the candidate will be encouraged and supported to reflect on how this project would help them develop the skills needed to pursue their desired future career.\nFor candidates who are interested, this experience also provides opportunities for additional paid work beyond the work-study hours (to be discussed with the work-study supervisor).","division":"Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":248980,"numPositions":2,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Research: Mixed-Methods","qualifications":"Required Qualifications:\nFoundational knowledge, skills, and competence in human factors or cognitive psychology.\nFoundational knowledge, skills, and competence in inferential statistics.\nExcellent communication and reading comprehension skills.\nPreferred Qualifications:\nPrior experience with systematic review and/or statistical meta-anlysis.\nPrior experience in a role where data quality and integrity are key to successful outcomes.","scholarshipRecipientPreference":"No preference will be given to scholarship recipients","skills":"Communication\nTeamwork","supervisor":"Dina Kanaan","supervisorTitle":"Post-doctoral Fellow","title":"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Assistant","weeklySchedule":"Variable Hours","workStudyStream":"Research Experience Stream"},{"accessibilityAccommodations":"I confirm accommodations will be made available as needed by the candidate","accessibilityConsiderations":"Spends the majority of the shift working at a computer\nOccurs in a hybrid environment\nHas a significant amount of independent work with limited oversight and direction","applicationDeadline":"May\n 1, 2025\n 11:59 PM","applicationDocuments":"Resume,Cover Letter","applicationProcedure":"Through CLNx","campusLocation":"St. George","degreeLevel":null,"department":"Experiential Learning & Professional Development","departmentOverview":"The Experiential Learning and Outreach Support (ELOS) Office in the Faculty of Arts and Science collaborates with academic units and community and industry partners to plan, develop, and implement quality experiential learning initiatives for Arts and Science students at the St. George Campus.

It is hallmarked by recurrent episodes of acute severe pain due to vaso-occlusive crisis, which occurs when sickled red blood cells obstruct blood flow. Approximately 30% of people with SCD also live with chronic daily pain. Youth experience increased SCD pain burden as they grow from childhood to adolescence and young adulthood. Digital technologies offer convenient, engaging ways to deliver self-management support to youth. In addition to improving access to care, these technologies can empower youth to take on more active roles in managing their condition by providing in-the-moment access to symptom tracking, goal setting, CBT- based skills training, and community support. iCanCope with SCD is a digital therapeutic program that delivers pain self-management support to youth aged 12-18 years with SCD. The program includes symptom tracking, goal setting, cognitive behavioural therapy-based skills training, and community support. A pan-North American clinical trial (NCT03201874) demonstrates innovation effectiveness in significantly improving pain-related outcomes. However, it is unknown how and when the iCanCope self-management program can be optimally implemented in the real-world of SCD care.\niCanCope with SCD is a digital therapeutic program that delivers pain self-management support to youth aged 12-18 years with SCD.

Of particular value is the experience the work study students will gain communicating difficult and disappointing information through rejection letters to authors. Through writing rejection letters, work study students will gain experience communicating difficult information with empathy and respect.\nPresentation Skills:\nDuring editorial meetings, work study students will gain experience summarizing complex information and providing evidence to support their recommendations on next steps for manuscripts. The presentation skills work study students will develop in these meetings will help them to speak with confidence and communicate clearly and precisely in professional settings.\nAnalytical Skills:\nWork study students will strengthen their analytical skills by reading and assessing submitted manuscripts. They will analyze manuscripts to determine if they fit within the journal's aims and scope and if they push the field of curriculum studies in new directions.\nTime Management Skills:\nWork study students will be expected to complete work by set deadlines, proving them with experience prioritizing competing responsibilities and managing their time in a way that allows them to complete tasks according to the timeline.\nTechnical Skills:\nWork study students will develop proficiency using Curriculum Inquiry's online submission system, which will provide them with experience learning new software and trouble-shooting technical problems.\nTeamwork Skills:\nWork study students will have the opportunity to work closely with other members of the editorial team. By working together as a team, they will develop skills in collaboration, fostering respectful dialogue, and building consensus between people with competing viewpoints.\n•Workplace Experience & Belonging:\nBy participating in editorial meetings, work study students will gain experience preparing for meetings, presenting information, sharing their ideas, and engaging in respectful dialogue and debate with colleagues who bring diverse perspectives to the work. Editorial meeting discussions will provide work study students with experience listening to different viewpoints, compromising, and building consensus. They will also develop an understanding of what is expected of employees during meetings in professional settings, such as the importance of arriving prepared and on time, taking turns speaking, and staying on topic.\nWork study students will also have the opportunity to network and build professional relationships with advanced graduate students and faculty members at the University of Toronto as well as other institutions. Building an academic network will be particularly valuable for work study students hoping to pursue an academic career. For example, during Curriculum Inquiry's annual Writers' Retreat, work study students will gain experience meeting new people and developing new relationships in professional settings. In addition to the interpersonal skills required to build professional relationships, at the retreat work study students will have the opportunity to build their professional networks across academic institutions, learn about academic jobs as well as other career pathways pursued by people with PhDs in their field, and learn about academic cultures at other institutions and in other countries.\n•Academic Connection:\nWork study students will apply their academic knowledge of curriculum studies to the publishing industry and academic workplaces. The reading, writing, and critical thinking skills students develop through their graduate studies, combined with the knowledge of publishing processes they'll gain through their work with Curriculum Inquiry, will enable them to pursue publishing careers such as Journal Manager or Acquisitions Editor.\nMoreover, the in-depth knowledge about academic journal publishing they will gain will be particularly helpful should they choose to publish their own research in pursuit of an academic job.\nThe skills work study students will gain through their work with Curriculum Inquiry, combined with the knowledge and skills they are gaining through their graduate studies, will also be transferrable to fields outside of academia and publishing. The research skills and subject-matter expertise in curriculum studies, combined with the non-academic writing, relationship-building, presentation, and verbal communication skills they will develop through their work with Curriculum Inquiry will make them strong candidates for roles in government ministries of education (e.g., curriculum developer, policy analyst), in the non-profit sector (e.g., developing and delivering curriculum for out-of-school programming), and non-faculty roles in universities (e.g., staff members on research ethics boards).\n•Career Reflection & Growth:\nAt the beginning of the contract, work study students will be asked to reflect on what they'd like to get out of the work experience, career paths they're interested in pursuing, and specific skills or competencies they'd like to develop. Then they will meet one-on-one with the supervisor to discuss ways to ensure these goals can be a focus of the students' work.\nMid-way through the contract, the work study students will be asked to think about their experiences so far, if they've been getting what they hoped out of the experience, and if there have been any shifts in the skills or competencies they'd like to develop. Additionally, they'll be asked to map out how their work with Curriculum Inquiry aligns with their career plans and identify any ways in which their work with the journal could be more useful to their career goals. Then, the work study students will have another one-on-one meeting with the supervisor to discuss their reflections and make a plan for the remainder of the contract.\nAt the end of the contract, the work study students will be asked to reflect on what they've gained through the experience. They will then meet with the supervisor to discuss their work-related plans going forward and brainstorm future work the student might consider taking on to continue building their workplace skills and competencies in ways that align with their career goals.","division":"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education","hoursPerWeek":"No more than 15 hours per week","id":249035,"numPositions":1,"organization":"University of Toronto","positionType":"Project Coordination and Assistance","qualifications":"Required Qualifications:\n• PhD student whose research connects to the field of curriculum studies\n• Knowledge of critical approaches to scholarship and their application to education and/or curriculum studies, typically gained through courses focused on topics like critical race studies, Indigenous studies, Black studies, decolonization and anticolonialism, queer and trans studies, disability studies\n• Strong critical reading and writing skills\n• Willingness to work both independently and as part of a team\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Interest and/or knowledge of academic publishing gained through working with an academic publisher or journal, serving as a peer reviewer, (co-)editing an edited collection, publishing your own work, etc.\n• Knowledge of methodologies used in educational research\n• Familiarity with research ethics\n• Interest in and/or knowledge of the field of publishing","scholarshipRecipientPreference":"No preference will be given to scholarship recipients","skills":"Communication\nInquiry\nTeamwork","supervisor":"Arlo Kempf","supervisorTitle":"Associate Professor","title":"Curriculum Inquiry Editorial Team Member","weeklySchedule":"Monday - Friday","workStudyStream":"Research Experience Stream"},{"accessibilityAccommodations":"I confirm accommodations will be made available as needed by the candidate","accessibilityConsiderations":"Spends the majority of the shift working at a computer\nOccurs in a remote environment\nOccurs in a hybrid environment\nOccurs in an in-person environment","applicationDeadline":"April\n 18, 2025\n 11:59 PM","applicationDocuments":"Resume,Cover Letter,Transcript (Unofficial)","applicationProcedure":"Through CLNx","campusLocation":"St. George","degreeLevel":null,"department":"Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy","departmentOverview":"This project will take place in the department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Temerty Faculty of Medicine.

The goal is to identify themes that emerged from the reflective writing. We asked students what resonated most with them in an experiential education component of a 4th year Pharmacology course. We have no pre-identified themes, but rather wish to use a student-centred approach to uncover what themes emerged from the class of 4th year students. Specifically, there are 60 student written end-of-course reflections of approximately 500 words each. In partnership with a qualitative analyst, the Education Research Assistant will read the anonymous and de-identified reflections and identify up to 10 emergent themes. The themes will be refined through iteration and consultation with the supervisor and the qualitative analysis partner. Then, with these themes, the Education Research Assistant will organize and categorize the student writing according to the themes. Within each theme (for example, a theme could be \"empathy and compassion\"), the student will identify the frequency and proportion of writing that addresses the theme. The labeling of phrases and sentences according to theme is a qualitative research process called Coding. It is different from the kind of \"coding\" that is done during computer programming. The student Educational Research Assistant will identify quotes from student writing that exemplify the theme and provide specific examples in the student first-person voice. Our goal in the project is to identify emergent themes that student authors consider to be important, and to respect and reflect the diversity of student responses. To this end, qualitative research analysis will help provide insights about the students' perspectives at the level of the whole class (clusters) and at the level of the individual student author (quotes).

This involves collecting sediment cores from diverse ocean floor regions, representing varied sedimentary environments based on composition, organic matter content, oxygen levels, and burial depths. Major and trace elements in these samples will be analyzed to identify the geochemical factors that controlled the sedimentation processes, while sequential extraction techniques will determine the chemical structure of P.

Main components of the work include the following.\n1. Through on-line research, the scientists to be featured will be identified. In the process, students will hone their ability to search the science literature. Although each student will have a unique discipline to research, students will support and communicate with each other. At our weekly meetings, students will share strategies for doing this research.\n2. Students will construct slides that present the profiles of the selected scientists. In doing so they will exercise their creativity in slide design and formatting, will learn the use of alt text and other accessibility guidelines, and will learn how to create QR codes to link to details of the scientists' research. In the notes section of their slides students will provide suggestions for where the slide would best fit into the course curriculum, requiring them to think more deeply about the scientific content of the profile.\n3. The students' slides will be submitted for review by potential end users, i.e. professors of first-year STEM courses. These reviews will be discussed at a group meeting and students will then respond to the reviewers in a process similar to that of peer review when submitting a manuscript for publication in a scientific journal.
