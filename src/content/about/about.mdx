## **Hey, I'm Sadman!**

**I'm a software engineer with a passion for building cool (& useful!) things.** Currently heavily focused on microservices in Python, but I also dabble in distributed systems, command line tools, web apps, and lots more!

I love exploring new technologies and sharing my knowledge with others, which is why I started this blog in the first place.

I also love reading (like, to death; I'd read the recipes on the back of a soup can). You can track all my latest read books at [/reading](sadman.ca/reading).

Always open to chats and coffee in Toronto. [Reach out](mailto:sadman.hossain@mail.utoronto.ca) and we can meet up!
