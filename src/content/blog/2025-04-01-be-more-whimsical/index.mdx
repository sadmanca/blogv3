  April Cools' Club is all about producing genuine content that's very different from your normal produced content. 
  
  I usually use this blog to write about technical topics in (software) engineering, but given the occasion I'd like to take this opportunity to write something a bit more contemplative.

## Most of life is boring

Some of life can be exciting. But most of it is boring.

- Morning routines are boring (wake up, brush teeth, eat breakfast, commute to work). 
- Most of work is boring (if your day job is amazing every day of the week, then all the power to you... but more likely than not, it's far from that for most of the workday everyday). 
- Doing the dishes is boring. 
- Relaxing after work is nice. But you only get such little time for it.

It's different for everyone, yes, but some part of life always remains mundane.

The worst part is: *it doesn't stop*. 

The boring parts of life continue day-in, day-out, for the rest of your adult life (the kids have it good, but they're not old enough to realize that yet).

**We spend most of our lives doing things we don't want to do.**

It's bit of a bleak thought, innit? 

We only have such little time to do the things we like.

**But that doesn't mean we can't learn to like doing the boring bits.**

## You gotta make sh*t whimsical sometimes

I came across this post the other day on Reddit, something that really brightened my day out of nowhere and inspired me to write this post in the first place:

There's nothing stopping you from doing whatever you can to make the mundane things in life more fun.

You don't need permission to inject joy into ordinary moments. Life is entirely too short to wait for the right time to feel silly, playful, or even just gently amused by your daily routine. We often assume there's a secret trick to happiness, but maybe the secret is simpler: choose to smile at the boring bits.

- **Walking to work?** Give your route names inspired by medieval adventures: "Crossing the Bridge of Boredom," "Passing through the Forest of Stoplights," or "Escaping the Dungeon of the Crowded Bus."

- **Laundry day?** Narrate your chores like you're hosting a home makeover show. "Next up on 'Extreme Laundry Makeover,' will these socks finally reunite? Stay tuned to find out!"

- **Paying bills?** Pretend you're a powerful lord or lady generously bestowing wealth upon humble service providers in your kingdom, signing checks with a flourish and perhaps a wax seal if you're feeling particularly regal.

### Whimsy doesn't have to be loud or elaborate

It can be as subtle as deciding that your morning coffee isn't just coffee; it's your personal, magical elixir crafted by an alchemist (you) in your cozy kitchen-lab.

Or just throw your socks in the laundry basket like you're shooting nothing but net.

We have the unique ability to reshape our relationship with daily drudgery into something richer. It's not some lifelong commitment, or some grand way of deriving meaning from life. 

**It's just a choice to have a bit of fun in the moment.**
