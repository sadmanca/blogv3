> It's funny, if not for the randomest set of events yesterday morning, I wouldn't have even known about Blaugust.

Seriously, this is the exact chain of events that led to me writing this very post:
1. I take look through one of my favourite blogs, Stanko TadiÄ‡'s [muffinman.io](https://muffinman.io/), and I come across his post on the ["Blog Questions Challenge"](https://muffinman.io/blog/blog-question-challenge/) from early this year.
2. I check out his link to the original set of questions on [Ava's blog](https://blog.avas.space/bear-blog-challenge/), where I see she's invited a bunch of other people to participate in the challenge too (like, 20 people in total).
3. I randomly check out the link to the first person she's mentioned ([Robert Birming](https://birming.com/)), and what do I find mentioned in the [first blog post](https://birming.com/2025/08/09/our-kryptonite/) there? That's right, I see Blaugust, for the first time in my life.
4. And from there it's just a bit of a journey down the rabbit hole as I go from link to link exploring what everyone's done for Blaugust.
