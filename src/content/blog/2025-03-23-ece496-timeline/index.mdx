## What it's like to take ECE496 at UofT

The engineering capstone design project course (ECE496) is arguably the most important course you'll take in your entire undergrad at UofT Engineering, let alone in your final year. It's a year-long course that runs from September to April and is an opportunity for you to work on a real-world engineering project from idea formation to (hopefully) a working established prototype.

There's not much information available online about what the course is actually like, so I've decided to share a comprehensive timeline of what the ECE496 experience is like from my 4th year of engineering undergrad.

<Callout type="info">
  As I formally begin ECE496 in September 2025, I'll be updating this timeline with more specific dates, along with experiences and any tips I have for future students taking the course.

    ### ECE496 Info Session

    Held in-person on the St. George campus in the evening (livestreamed online and recorded for students who can't make it), this is your first official introduction to the ECE496 Engineering Capstone Design Project course. 

    The session covers the following topics:
    
   - Understanding your capstone project course options: ECE496, APS490, and BME498 
   - Important deadlines from now until September
   - Forming a team, finding, and registering for a project 
   - Tips on how to get started
   - Coming to the ECE Capstone Design Fair for project inspiration

    <Callout type="info">
      If you're doing PEY, then you'll still receive an invite for the info session the year your PEY is scheduled to begin. 
      
      It's a good idea to attend so you can start thinking about your capstone project early (e.g. if you're planning to build a team with friends).

    ### ECE Capstone Design Fair

    Head on over to Myhal 150 to see undergraduate students showcase their capstone projects. The fair is a great opportunity to:
    
    - Learn about different approaches to capstone projects
    - Gather ideas for your own project
    - Network with peers and faculty

    To get a preview, you can read through some of the [capstone design fair news releases](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aece.utoronto.ca%2Fnews+capstone) by the UofT ECE department from past years.

    Professor Khoman Phang is one of the main coordinators of ECE496 and he uploads highlights from the annual ECE Capstone Design Fair onto a [YouTube playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtIXs_v5KfKlSwE5DQ3yk99qBAT7nu50e).

    ### Find your supervisor + team, register for ECE496, & start background research

    In the few months leading up to September, registration for yourself and your ECE496 team will open on the official ECE496 website (yes, there is a specific website for registering in ECE496).

    If you don't have a project or a team come September then you'll be assigned one by the course coordinators (which you may not like, so you should think about this early!).

    ### Meet your administrator

    Your team will get assigned an administrator who will be your main point of contact for the course. They will help you with any questions you have about the course, deadlines, and project deliverables.

    ### Submit project proposal (draft)

    Before starting to work on your project, your team will need to write a draft of a formal proposal document (outlining your project idea, timeline, and deliverables). This document will be reviewed by your project supervisor and administrator in a proposal meeting before you can officially start working on your project.
  </TimelineEntry>

  <TimelineEntry 
    date="Week 3-5" 
    status="planned"
    subtitle="late September-early October 2025"

    ### Proposal meeting

    After submitting a draft of your project proposal, your team will need to organize a meeting with all stakeholders (including your project supervisor, administrator, and any external partners) to discuss any feedback and changes to your proposal.

    Your team will also need to answer any questions that the stakeholders have about the project. This step is important for getting any misunderstanding about what you're planning to build out of the way so you can start working on your project with a clear vision.

    The results from this meeting with be formally included in your final project proposal document which you'll need to submit a few weeks after the proposal meeting.

    ### Submit project proposal (final)

    Continue working on your final project proposal document and submit it to your project supervisor and administrator for review. This document will be used as a reference for the rest of the project.

    <Callout type="warning">
      Your proposal is there to provide some structure to your design project, but it does not mean that you are beholden to it. You can change your project topic, scope, timeline, and deliverables as you see fit (with the approval of your project supervisor and administrator).

      Note that it is recommended to do this early on in the project if you're considering making any changes, as it can be difficult to pivot later on.

    ### End-of-term report & demo meeting

    With your project proposal finalized, your team can finally (officially) begin working on your project!

    As you approach the end of the term, you'll also need to start working on your end-of-term report and demo. This report will be a comprehensive document that outlines your project, the work you've done, and the results you've achieved. 
    
    You'll also need to prepare a demo of your project to show to your project supervisor and administrator. This demo is an important opportunity to showcase your work and receive feedback, and can be whatever it is you were working on during the term (hardware, software, or otherwise). It doesn't have to be complete, but you do need something that you can showcase in the meeting.

    <Callout type="info">
      The demo meeting is typically scheduled for the last 2 weeks of lectures before the fall exam season starts. It's a good idea to start preparing for this meeting early so you're not scrambling at the last minute.

    ### Practical oral presentations

    The practical oral presentations are an opportunity to present your work to your peers and receive feedback. 

    <Callout type="info">
      It's important to prepare thoroughly for these presentations to make a good impression and to learn from the feedback you receive!
