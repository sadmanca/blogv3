It's been `112 days` since my last post. 

**It's time for something new.**

Following in the footsteps of the person who first introduced me to Blaugust (thanks [Robert Birming](https://birming.com/2025/08/02/blaugust-with-photos-and-music/)), I've decided to join the [**Blaugust 2025**](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/10/blaugust-2025-is-coming/) blog challenge. 

<Callout2 title="What is Blaugust?" variant="note" defaultOpen={true}>
  **Blaugust** is month-long event where bloggers challenge themselves to post more often (31 posts for the 31 days in August) and engage with others the Blaugust community.

## Addressing the elephant in the room

Yes, I do realize that we are more than halfway through the month of August. In my defense, I only learned of the existence of Blaugust itself through sheer coincidence, after the first week of August was already over.

I don't plan on writing 2 posts a day for every day remaining in the month, it's far too much work and the only way I could manage such high output is if I published very short and low quality posts. I don't want to do that; I want to write words that I'm proud of, words that I want others to read.

I'm not going to publish 31 posts in the next 2 weeks, but I sure as hell am going to try to publish more than I have been for the past few months. 

I think at least one post a week is a good target to start off with. Easy to achieve, with room for me to publish more often if I get the opportunity. I probably won't be able to do more than that, but I aim to try. 

And that's all that matters to me. **I'm ok with whatever happens as long as I try.**

## What I plan to write about

**I'm still not sure.** I have lots of longer form blog posts planned in the pipeline around my niche interests (including some about my experiences at the [University of Toronto](https://sadman.ca/tags/UofT)), so it would be great if I could get those published.

As I mentioned above, one post a day does mean very little time to write (especially when you're juggling a full time job along with other obligations... also it's the end of summer, you gotta live it up a little while it lasts), so I'm not even going to try to hit that goal. 

But one post a week on work & the software industry, on higher education, on self-improvement or just life in general, *that* is something I *can* do.

And for when the inspiration runs dry, thankfully there's also a list of [weekly prompts for Blaugust 2025](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/25/blaugust-2025-calendar-weekly-prompts) that look good for jump-starting the creative writing juices.

### Things I might try to put on my blog this month

- What others have written for Blaugust in the past
- Cool pages and features I've found in other blogs online (I have a huge list, there are so many!)
- Tutorials on tools & apps I find myself using a lot (for work & personal projects)
- A typical "day in the life" working in my current role
- Lots of fun stuff around the University of Toronto (have you ever heard of the Academic Tribunal?)
- A list of blog challenges and when they take place during the year
- How I discovered Blaugust in the first place (what I like to call a "happy accident")
- Thoughts about life? I don't see why not :)

## Closing thoughts

Originally I had a few more sections around what people have written for Blaugust in the past and how *I* discovered the Blaugust community, but seeing as that I'm already well behind when it comes to writing posts for this month, I think it's best those topics are saved for posts of their own.

**Even if Iâ€™m starting late, Blaugust 2025 is the perfect excuse for me to shake off the dust and start again.**
