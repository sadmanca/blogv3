## I think I'm going to do this every year

Someone on Discord asked me a few days ago if I was planning on creating a work study jobs dashboard for the upcoming academic year. My answer?

**Heck yeah.**

It's been almost a year from when I first started creating custom dashboards to show work study jobs, and since then these dashboards have become some of my most viewed pages (I'm sure that showing up on the first page of results when you google "uoft work study" helped).

I get told by students all the time about how useful these dashboards are to them for combing through all the jobs they might be interested in and for submitting their applications.

For me, it just takes a few minutes to manually scrape the data off of the UofT CLNx portal to JSON (I've written more about the process in [last year's blog post](/blog/work-study-at-uoft)), and then a few more minutes to add a page for the new dashboard. But for people using it, it just makes life so much easier.

If you're a student who's never really looked through many work study job postings (or perhaps at all), I do recommend taking a look. Because even if you don't use it to land a work study position, it is a **fantastic** resource for finding professors that you might be interested in doing research with.

**As long as students keep using them, I'll keep making them.**
